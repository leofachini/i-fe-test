tarantino\n\nDocker compose\nRun docker-compose up in the application root directory, then access the application into http://localhost.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build or set NODE_ENV=production environment variable.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nAlso, worth notice that it will generate a code coverage report into ./coverage/ folder.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nRunning lint\nRun ng lint to execute the linter in the project.\nGenerate documentation\nRun npm run doc:gen to generate project documentation.\nGenerate documentation\nRun npm run doc:serve to serve the generated project documentation.\nFurther help\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 8.3.20.\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nPain points\n\nFound problems with style of inner elements inside ng-content, reggarding ng-deep\n\nDecide about where to declare components in a SharedModule or to repeat some of them in each modules\n\nDocumentation\nUndetailed documentation definition of what need to be done, such as: Definition of what is \"Top priority\" regarding movies order.\nFound mismatching or outdated directions in documentation, in keep in mind section: \"So we will login with 1 user post some stuff, login with user 2 post more stuff and we will login with user 1 again and we hope see user 2 posts on user 1 timeline. I'm sure you all know have a social network works or should work\". We aren't suposed to create any post nothing on each oder timeline in this MyFlix chalenge.\n\n\nGood things\n\nUnit-test helped me to avoid errors in an refactoring that I've done\nEnd-To-End tests also helped me to avoid the break of the login functionality\nTypescript type really improve our capability of having miss type matchings (if used properly)\nAngular Material Components helped me to keep consistency in the UI\n\nFurther enhancements\n\nAdd support to multiple languages (i18n)\nAdd ghost elements for components that are doing back-end requests and blocking the UI from rendering\nAdd destructuring to Model constructors\nAdd header in named route to avoid handle ng-if there.\nMove header to a component instead of keep it in the app component.\nSet app routes in a constant variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
